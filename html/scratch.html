        The success of an artist comes largely from their ability to perform on the stage. Fans pay up to hundreds and even thousands to see their favorite artists perform, which leaves the responsibility of satisfaction on the shoulders of the artist.
        I have had the opportunity to see many artists in concert, and I hope to see many more. I feel as though reviewing shows is an essential part of reviewing music. If the song can't be performed well, then is it truly a good song?
        I understand a lot of the execution of a song's performance comes down to the artist, but if it is their song then they should be able to perform it well.
        With that being said, here are some concerts that either I have seen or others have and our thoughts on the showmanship of these artists.
    
    
    <!-- starting the commentary on each individual concert-->

    Attending a Bleachers concert feels like stepping into a sonic time machine, with Jack Antonoff at the helm, blending 80s-inspired synths and heartfelt lyricism. The band’s energy is infectious, and the crowd becomes part of the performance as Antonoff’s charisma bridges the gap between stage and audience.  
    
    Opening with *“Don’t Take the Money,”* the show set an electric tone, and songs like *“Rollercoaster”* and *“I Wanna Get Better”* amplified the room’s collective nostalgia. Antonoff’s raw emotion during *“Chinatown”* transformed the venue into a shared moment of introspection. Live, Bleachers excels at taking studio polish and infusing it with raw, human connection. Their intricate arrangements translate beautifully to the stage, thanks to their multi-instrumentalist lineup.  
    
    The highlight was undoubtedly the encore—a stripped-down version of *“Like a River Runs”* followed by an explosive rendition of *“Stop Making This Hurt.”* Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer, Bleachers live is a euphoric celebration of music, memory, and emotion.

    What sets Quinn XCII apart is his ability to make every venue feel intimate. His genuine interactions with the audience, paired with visuals that match his breezy, feel-good aesthetic, create an atmosphere of shared joy. He encouraged fans to sing along during *“Always Been You”* and had everyone on their feet for *“Love Me Less.”*  
    
    The production was refreshingly understated, allowing the focus to remain on the music. With a backing band that brought his melodies to life, the show’s sound was rich and dynamic.
